- Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database

## Results
The analysis was completed with the new ETL function performing properly.  The data was successfull added to a PostgreSQL database, as images of the   and the data is successfuly added to a PostgreSQL database as seen in the images below. The final code can be viewed here.
